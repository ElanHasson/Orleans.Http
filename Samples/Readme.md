# Samples

This samples directory show a very basic Silo that expose a grain with a few methods which are mapped to endpoints.

To run it, just run the `OrleansHttp.Host` project and it will listen for http on port 9090.

Have a look on `IHelloGrain` which contains the methods with the GET url descriptions for the sample.
